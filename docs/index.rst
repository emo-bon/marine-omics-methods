Marine omics methods
****************************************************

These package currently supports FAIR-EASE `pilot demos <https://github.com/emo-bon/momics-demos>`_, but eventually it can serve for general purpose manipulation of metagenomic data, locally and in VREs.

The idea is to provide testable methods to allow as much flexibility and remixing of the functionalities provided

European Marine Omics Biodiversity Observation Network
===========================================================

Specifically, we aim primarily to manipulate EMO-BON marine genomics sampling data and metadata from ENA project `PRJEB51688 <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51688>`_. The interactive dashboards and jupyter notebooks built on top of this repository can be found `here <https://github.com/emo-bon/momics-demos/tree/main>`_.

The methods are mixture of statistical methods, plotting functionalities, metadata and data handling utilities and generators of `holoviz panel` widgets and panes. Experimental integration to `Galaxy` uses a wrapper around `bioblend <https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

=================

FAIR-EASE jupyter-book on the `marine omics pilot <https://lab.fairease.eu/book-marine-omics-observation/>`_ is also updated in parallel and with extra analysis resources

FAIR-EASE `GitHub <https://github.com/fair-ease>`_, `website <https://fairease.eu/>`_ and `linkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/company/fair-ease/>`_.
